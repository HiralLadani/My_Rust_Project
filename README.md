Here I uploaded My Mini Task 3 Rust based console app on Student report card
 ğŸ“– Student Report Card (Rust Console App)

A simple Rust console application that:
- Takes a student's name, total marks, and number of subjects
- Calculates the average
- Assigns a grade based on the average:
  - A: 90+
  - B: 75â€“89
  - C: 60â€“74
  - D: Below 60
- Generates a clean PDF report card using the `genpdf` crate.
